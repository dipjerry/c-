Create a base class in C++ called ​shape​. Use this class to store two double type valuesthat could be used to compute the area of figures. 
Derive two specific classes called ​triangleand ​rectangle​ from the base shape. Add to the base class a member function ​get_data()​ toinitialize base class 
data members and another member function ​display_area()​ to computeand display the area of figures. Make ​display_area()​ a virtual function and redefine this 
functionin the derived classes to suit their requirements. Using these classes, design a program that willaccept the dimensions of a triangle or a rectangle 
interactively and display the area.
