A book-shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The listincludes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customerwants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system searches the list anddisplays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is,then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required. If therequired copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed; otherwise themessage "Required copies not in stock" is displayed. Design a system in C++ using a classcalled “books” with suitable member functions and constructors. Use ​new​ operator inconstructors to allocate memory space required.
