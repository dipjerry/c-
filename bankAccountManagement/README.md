Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called a Savings account and the other as a current account. 
The savings account gives compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides a 
checkbook facility but no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance andif the balance falls below this 
level, a service charge is imposed. Create a C++ class account that stores customer name, account number, and type of account. 
From this, derive the classes urr_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their requirements. Include necessary member 
functions in order to achieve the following tasks:
1.Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance
2.Display the balance
3.Compute and deposit interest
4.Permit withdrawal and update the balance
5.Check for the minimum balance, impose a penalty and update the balance
